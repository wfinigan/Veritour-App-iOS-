It was constructed in 1931 as part of President Lowell's plan to enclose the Yard from the traffic of Harvard Square. Past residents include Leonard Bernstein, Bill Gates, and Ted Kennedy. It also currently houses two of our three founders, Michael Cubeddu and Will Finigan!"),
            Descriptions(title: "Widener Library", description: "The Harry Elkins Widener Memorial Library, housing some 3.5 million books in its stacks, is the center­piece of the entire Harvard Library system. It honors 1907 Harvard College graduate and book collector Harry Elkins Widener, and was constructed by his mother Eleanor Elkins Widener after his death in the sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912.The library's holdings, which include works in more than one hundred languages, comprise one of the world's most comprehen­sive research collec­tions in the humanities and social sciences. Its 57 miles (92 km) of shelves, along five miles (8 km) of aisles on ten levels, comprise a \"labyrinth\" which one student \"could not enter without feeling that she ought to carry a compass, a sandwich, and a whistle.\" Campus legends holding that Harry Widener's fate led to institu­tion of an undergrad­uate swimming-proficiency requirement, and that an additional donation from his mother subsidizes ice cream at Harvard meals, are without foundation."),

Its Fong Lecture Hall seats 144. It was built in 1858 to house the anatomical museum of Jeffries Wyman, Professor of Comparative Anatomy, who in 1866 became the first curator of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology.It is considered by at least one authority to have been the homesite of the Rev. Thomas Hooker, first minister to the first church in Cambridge, although there are reasons to question this, including its distance from the original church site at the intersection of Dunster and Mt. Auburn Streets."),
            Descriptions(title: "Wadsworth House", description: "Built in 1726 for the president of Harvard, Benjamin Wadsworth, the house that shares his name is the second oldest building at Harvard (the first being Massachusetts Hall), and has a long and illustrious history. General George Washington, with the assistance of retired British General Charles Lee, set up his first Massachusetts headquarters in the house. From there, on July 3, 1775, Washington rode out to the Cambridge Common to take command of the Revolutionary troops. There is documentation that many notable figures from the time visited General Washington while he resided at Wadsworth House, including Abigail Adams and future speaker of the Massachusetts House James Warren.  It is also said that the plans to oust King George from Boston took form in Wadsworth Parlor. The General eventually took up more permanent residence at Vassall House, on what is now Brattle Street, and later the home of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. In 1849, when Jared Sparks decided to stay in his nearby home, presidents ceased to live in Wadsworth House. After that time, Wadsworth House took in student boarders (including Ralph Waldo Emerson '21) and visiting preachers, among others. Today, the building houses the offices of the University Marshal, Commencement, and several professors. On April 6, 2016, Harvard President Drew Faust unveiled a plaque on the side of Wadsworth House to memorialize the four enslaved persons who lived and worked in the building during the eighteenth century, and whose lives and stories had long been overlooked. President Faust was joined by civil rights icon Congressman John Lewis to mark the occasion."),

Past residents include Natalie Portman and Frank Rich. Home to about 100 freshmen, Grays consists of three vertical entryways whose “walk-up” architecture contributes to a strong sense of community. Suites are grouped into quads and quints with in-suite bathrooms and spacious common rooms. Overlooking Harvard Yard, Grays enjoys close proximity to Massachusetts Avenue and student favorites like J.P. Licks and Au Bon Pain."),

Kennedy during his freshman year. Consisting primarily of quints and sextuplets, with a mix of in-suite and hallway bathrooms, Weld also boasts long open hallways and an elevator making it a very friendly dorm. Bustling with activity, Weld basement is also home to Yard Operations and Dorm Crew, where one goes for toilet paper, free CFL light bulbs, or to ask for help with a problem relating to your room. Many remark that one of the best parts of Weld is its proximity to “everything important” at Harvard including Widener, Harvard’s largest and oldest library; the John Harvard statue; and Annenberg, the freshman dining hall."),
            Descriptions(title: "Matthews Hall", description: "Matthews Hall, completed in 1872 and named after Nathan Matthews, was home to Matt Damon, Chuck Schumer, and Senator Barney Frank. Thanks in part to two main foyers in the building, freshmen within the dorm get to know each other well. Situated in the heart of Harvard Yard, Matthews suites are doubles or triples with shared hallway bathrooms and spacious suite common rooms. Many past residents say they will really miss Matthews’ centralized location, with its view of the Yard proximity to the rest of the freshmen dorms and shops along Massachusetts Avenue."),

The stele was presented to the university by the Chinese Harvard Alumni for its Tercentenary in September 1936. In the 1930s there were five Harvard Clubs in China. More than 35 members of the clubs were known to be involved in donating the stele, and at least two of them attended the Tercentennial Ceremony in September 1936. They were Dr. J. Heng Liu, president of Harvard Club of Nanking, and Fred Sze, a banker and the president of Harvard Club of Shanghai. New inscriptions were carved on the front of the marble tablet. Shih Hu, who was invited to take part in the Tercentenary Celebration to receive an honorary doctoral degree from Harvard, was believed to be the calligrapher of the inscription."),
            Descriptions(title: "Massachusetts Hall", description: "Massachusetts Hall is the oldest surviving building at Harvard College, the first institution of higher learning in the British colonies in America, and second oldest academic building in the United States after the Wren Building at the College of William & Mary. As such, it possesses great significance not only in the history of American education but also in the story of the developing English Colonies of the 18th century. Massachusetts Hall was designed by Harvard Presidents John Leverett and his successor Benjamin Wadsworth. It was erected between 1718 and 1720 in Harvard Yard. It was originally a dormitory containing 32 chambers and 64 small private studies for the 64 students it was designed to house. During the siege of Boston, 640 American soldiers took quarters in the hall. Much of the interior woodwork and hardware, including brass doorknobs, disappeared at this time. While designed as a residence for students, the building has served many purposes through the years. After Thomas Hollis donated a quadrant and a 24-foot telescope in 1722, for example, the building housed an informal observatory. Currently, the President of the University, Provost, Treasurer, and Vice Presidents have offices that occupy the first two floors and half of the third. Freshmen reside in the fourth floor. Massachusetts Hall, as Harvard's oldest extant dormitory, has housed many influential people. Founding fathers who lived in Massachusetts Hall include John Adams, John Hancock, Samuel Adams, Elbridge Gerry, and James Otis. Members of the Wigglesworth, Weld, Thayer, Eliot, and Lowell families (among others), whose names now grace other dormitories, also lived in Massachusetts Hall. More recent notable residents of Massachusetts Hall include Alan Jay Lerner, Elliot Richardson and John Harbison."),
            Descriptions(title: "Strauss Hall", description: "Built in 1926 by three brothers to memorialize their parents, Isidor and Ida, who had died in the sinking of the RMS Titanic, Straus Hall boasts a central location near the heart of Harvard Yard. Consisting mainly of suites of quads, with some doubles and triples, Straus boasts in-suite bathrooms and hardwood floors. Many enjoy Straus’ relatively small vertical entryways of approximately 25 students, which makes meeting new people and making friends easy. Of course, Harvard Square is also on Straus’ doorstep making access to CVS, the Coop, Out of Town News, and other shops convenient and accessible. Lehman Hall, home to the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and Café Gato Rojo, is also next door to Straus."),
            Descriptions(title: "Lehman Dudley House", description: "Lehman Hall is a Georgian-revival building by Charles Coolidge completed in 1925 as part of Harvard President Abbott Lawrence Lowell's program to 'cloister' Harvard Yard. Named for donor Arthur Lehman (1873–1936) and his wife Adele, its exterior 'is a modified example of the early New England counting house.' It is the home of Dudley House, the only one of Harvard's thirteen undergraduate 'houses' serving nonresident students. In 1965 Lehman Hall assumed its current function as home of one of the thirteen undergraduate houses within Harvard College, Dudley House, which serves the very few Harvard undergraduates not living in one of the other twelve (residential) houses (that is, students living in off-campus apartments and in the student-run Dudley Coop)."),
            Descriptions(title: "University Hall", description: "University Hall is a white granite building designed by the great early American architect Charles Bulfinch and built by the noted early engineer Loammi Baldwin, Jr. It is located in Harvard Yard on the campus of Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1970 for its architectural significance. The hall was designed by Bulfinch, class of 1781, and built between 1813-15 of white Chelmsford granite, probably using rock cut to size at the Charlestown Prison. It consists of a partial basement story, plus three full stories raised above ground as well as an additional story set within the roofline. The long east and west facades are very similar, and symmetrically arranged with two entrances per facade, each flanked by pilasters; smaller north and south facades present rows of windows. Total construction cost was $65,000 of which $53,000 was paid by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. University Hall's first floor contained the College Commons (dining room) until 1849. The building also contained a library and philosophical (scientific) apparatus, as well as a chapel within the second and third floors. A massive portico with stone pillars was added to the western facade soon after completion, but removed in 1842. In 1849 the first floor was partitioned into classrooms; in 1867 the chapel was partitioned as well. In 1896 the chapel was restored and used for meetings of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. In 1924 Daniel Chester French's bronze statue of John Harvard was moved to the western façade from its original location near Memorial Hall. In 1969, Harvard students took over the hall and occupied it for 18 hours in protest of Harvard's stance on the Vietnam War. The demonstration ended only when Massachusetts state police arrived to remove the students from the building."),
            Descriptions(title: "Thayer (Dorm)", description: "Built in 1870, Thayer lies at the heart of Harvard Yard and its residents enjoy close proximity to Annenberg Dining Hall, the Science Center, Widener and Lamont Libraries, as well as the University’s Plaza. Freshmen in Thayer share doubles and triples with spacious common rooms and hall-style bathrooms. The building's wide hallways and elevator allow residents to get to know each other well, contributing to the fact that Thayer is often a very social dorm with tight-knit community. Famous former residents include poet e.e. cummings and actor Jonathan Taylor Thomas."),
            Descriptions(title: "Hollis (Dorm)", description: "Built in 1763, Hollis is one of the oldest buildings at Harvard College. Famous residents include Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, and Jim Cramer. Currently home to 60 freshmen, Hollis also hosted General George Washington’s troops during the American War for Independence. Boasting spacious, wood-paneled, single-room doubles with common bathrooms, Hollis is divided into two vertical entryways, making the community very tight-knit. Thanks to its position in the heart of Harvard Yard and proximity to Harvard Square, one past resident remarked that Hollis is “in the middle of it all” – true given that it is a three-minute walk from classes in Sever, Robinson, and Emerson Halls, as well as the Science Center and Annenberg."),
            Descriptions(title: "Stoughton (Dorm)", description: "Stoughton, built in 1805, was the second building to bear that name at Harvard. The original dormitory was built in 1700 and funded by Massachusetts Lieutenant Governor William Stoughton who presided over the Salem Witch Trials. Stoughton houses freshmen in large single room doubles with common bathrooms. One student remarked on how he enjoyed the social layout of the room, 'Stoughton combines the comfort of a bedroom with the spacious luxury of a living room.' Ideally located, Stoughton is a short walk from the Science Center and Annenberg Dining Hall. Johnston Gate is also very close by, which makes trips to CVS and other Harvard Square shops easy."),
            Descriptions(title: "Holworthy", description: "Holworthy, built in 1812, is named after Sir Matthew Holworthy, who gave 1,000 Pounds Sterling to Harvard in 1678. Famous residents include Horatio Alger and Conan O’ Brian. Now home to 84 freshmen and divided into three vertical entryways, Holworthy is composed of quads with two bedrooms and a common room, with a shared bathroom with the suite next door. Holworthy also boasts a convenient location, with its sweeping view of Harvard Yard and close proximity to Annenberg, the freshman dining hall, and the Science Center, a central classroom space. Hemenway Gymnasium, the Littaeur Center, Cambridge Common, the Fine Arts Library, and the University’s Plaza are also only a short walk away."),
            Descriptions(title: "Memorial Church", description: "The current Memorial Church was built in 1932 in honor of the men and women of Harvard University who died in World War I. The University Architects Coolidge, Shepley, Bulfinch & Abbott, were enlisted to design the new building, and they planned a structure that would complement the imposing edifice of Widener Library. This created an open area known as the Tercentenary Theatre, where Commencement Exercises are held. The names of 373 alumni were engraved within alongside a sculpture named The Sacrifice by Malvina Hoffman.It was dedicated on Armistice Day on November 11, 1932. The knight's face in The Sacrifice was modelled on the British World War I flying ace, Ian Henderson. Since then, other memorials have been established within the building commemorating those Harvardians who later died in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. For seventy-five years, it has stood in Harvard Yard opposite Widener Library as a physical reminder of Harvard's spiritual heritage. Since its inception, the Harvard Memorial Church has had weekly choral music provided at its Sunday services by the Harvard University Choir, which is composed of both graduate and undergraduate students in the university."),
            Descriptions(title: "Canaday", description: "Canaday, which houses 255 freshmen students as well as the Harvard College Women’s Center, is Harvard’s newest and largest freshman dorm as well as one of the most conveniently located in the Yard. Residents are able to get to both Annenberg Dining Hall and the Science Center in less than a minute, and many other classrooms as well as the University Plaza are close at hand. Canaday is divided into seven vertical entryways consisting of a variety of suites from singles to sextuplets. Some rooms on the top floors also have skylights, which give them great natural light. Canaday’s courtyard also serves as a great space for all students to congregate."),
            Descriptions(title: "Sever Hall", description: "Sever Hall was built from 1878 to 1880 with a gift from Anne Sever in honor of her deceased husband, James Warren Sever. It was designed as an academic building with classrooms, lecture halls, rooms for professors, etc., in a style now known as Richardsonian Romanesque though in red brick rather than stone. About 1.3 million bricks were used in its construction. Of these, some 100,000 form the exterior facades, which feature 60 different varieties of red molded brick, as well as elaborate brick carvings. The archway admitting entrance into the west facade possesses an acoustical oddity. Whispering directly into the bricks of the archway, while standing very close to one side of the arch, can be heard clearly on the other side of the arch (approximately twelve feet away). In recent years, there has been renewed interest in Sever Hall among architectural historians, due to Robert Venturi's comment that it is his 'favorite building in America.' He told Boston Globe critic Robert Campbell: 'I have come to understand the validity of architecture as generic shelter rather than abstract-expressive sculpture, and as flexible loft for accommodating evolving functions . . . And then I love Sever Hall also for its aesthetic tension deriving from its vital details. I could stand and look at it all day. Thank you, H.H. Richardson.' Sever has small classrooms and larger lecture halls, so it is mostly used as a general-purpose classroom building for humanities courses especially small sections, beginning language courses, and Harvard Extension School classes. Grossman Library, a non-circulating library serving Extension School students, is located on the third floor. The fourth floor of Sever, unnoticed by many of its students as the central stairwell does not lead to it, contains offices for Harvard's Visual and Environmental Studies department. In the evenings and on weekends student groups hold meetings or run annual events. One of Sever's notable annual events is Vericon, run during the break between semesters by the Harvard-Radcliffe Science-Fiction Association."),
            Descriptions(title: "Emerson Hall", description: "Since 1905, Emerson Hall has been the home of the Department of Philosophy at Harvard University. Designed by Guy Lowell, the building is named for Transcendentalist writer, philosopher, and Harvard alumnus Ralph Waldo Emerson (A.B. 1821; LL.D. 1866). A bronze statue of Emerson by artist Frank Dubeneck was installed on the first floor of the building on May 25, 1905, to mark what would have been Emerson's 102nd birthday. The statue remains there today. Emerson Hall opened for use in the middle of the 1905-06 academic year. Originally the hall contained two libraries on its second floor: Robbins Library of Philosophy—named for Reginald C. Robbins, '92, whose generous gift to the department made possible the acquisition of its original collection—and a social ethics library. Each also had its own librarian: Dr. Benjamin Rand served as the first Robbins librarian, and Dr. D. C. Rogers oversaw the social ethics library. Today, only the Robbins Library remains, but its largely unchanged interior provides a striking example of early 20th century library design. Initially, the entirety of Emerson Hall's third floor was devoted to the Psychological Laboratory under the direction of Dr. Hugo Münsterberg. The Psychological Laboratory contained twenty-seven rooms, among which were class rooms, a photography room, a soundproof room, various animal rooms, an instrument room, a wood-shop, and a Vivarium housing birds, monkeys, rabbits, guinea-pigs, mice, rats, frogs, turtles, and other reptiles. Today the third floor contains faculty and administrative offices as well as seminar rooms, a graduate student lounge, and a lecture hall."),
            Descriptions(title: "Lamont Library", description: "Lamont Library, in the south-east corner of Harvard Yard houses the Harvard College Library's primary undergraduate collection in humanities and social sciences. It was the first library in the United States specifically planned to serve undergraduates. Lamont was built as part of a program to address dwindling stack space, and patron overcrowding, at Widener Library. Keyes D. Metcalf, Librarian of Harvard College and Director of the Harvard University Library from 1937 to 1955, planned the building with Boston architect Henry R. Shepley.Opened in 1949, it is named for its principal donor, Harvard alumnus Thomas W. Lamont. Lamont's general collection of 200,000 volumes began with transfers from Widener, the Boylston Hall reserve-book collections, and the Harvard Union Reading Room. A modified version Dewey classification scheme was used, and the main spaces included capacious open-shelf alcoves for browsing, study, and research. The Library of Congress Classification system was adopted in the 1970s"),
            Descriptions(title: "Harvard Hall", description: "Harvard Hall is a classroom building in Harvard Yard. The present Harvard Hall replaces an earlier structure which burned on January 24, 1764, destroying 4,500 of the College Library's 5,000 books as well as its collection of 'philosophical apparatus' (scientific instruments). The Massachusetts General Court, which had been meeting in Harvard Hall to escape a smallpox epidemic in Boston, took responsibility for the fire and funded reconstruction. Thanks to generous donors such as Thomas Hollis V and John Hancock, within two years the new Harvard Hall housed a library larger than that the College had before the fire.Under the specific advice of Benjamin Franklin, a new collection of scientific instruments and electrical demonstration equipment was acquired (mostly in London) to replace the apparatus that had been lost in the fire. The collection he assembled would later become part of the Harvard Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments, now on public display in the Harvard Science Center."),

A memorial to Lionel de Jersey, the only relative of John Harvard to attend Harvard, Lionel is a quaint setting with fantastic suites of triplets and quads, all of which have in-suite bathrooms. Lionel is very conveniently located in Harvard Yard, accessible to classrooms in the Science Center, Annenberg Dining Hall, and Harvard Square shops such as CVS, the Coop, and Border Cafe. Lionel also shares its own courtyard with Mower, which offers some peaceful seclusion from the rest of Harvard Yard."),
            Descriptions(title: "Science Center", description: "The Harvard University Science Center is Harvard's main classroom and laboratory building for undergraduate science and mathematics, in addition to housing numerous other facilities and services. Harvard had been interested in building an undergraduate science center in the 1950s and 1960s. However, in the midst of an economic decline, funding could not be found. No concrete plans were made until in 1968, Edwin Land, inventor of the Polaroid ‘Land’ camera, made a $12.5 million donation to construct a science center specifically for undergraduates. Located just north of Harvard Yard, the Science Center was built in 1972 and opened in 1973 after a design by Josep Lluís Sert (then dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Design)."),
            Descriptions(title: "Annenberg Dining Hall", description: "Named in memory of Roger Annenberg, '62 and inspired by the great halls of Oxford and Cambridge Universities, this room is arguably the most impressive space at Harvard.The hall covers an expansive 9,000 square feet. Architectural features include the great hammerbeam trusses, stenciled ceiling, and walnut paneling. Over the hall, on the east end, the imaginative stairway sequence leading to the tower meeting rooms works with the ceiling trusses and the polychromatic brick wall to create a myriad of geometric patterns. Annenberg Hall houses a vast collection of paintings, sculpture and stained glass. The recent restoration, made possible through the generosity of Walter Annenberg and the Annenberg Foundation, allowed the vast and geographically central facility to, once again, serve a daily purpose in the lives of undergraduates. The hall is now used as a dining facility for first year students and is occasionally made available for other University and Community events. During the academic year, Harvard's Dining Services department serves approximately 3,400 meals each day in Annenberg Hall. Annenberg Hall is not available for public viewing."),

A member of the League of Historic American Theatres, the 1,000 seat theatre offers a unique and intimate 180 degree design which provides unusual proximity to the stage. The theatre was designed to function as a major lecture hall and as the site of college commencements. Although Sanders saw its last commencement exercise in 1922, the theatre continues to play a major role in the academic mission of Harvard College, hosting undergraduate core curriculum courses, the prestigious Charles Eliot Norton Lectures, and the annual Phi Beta Kappa induction ceremony. Many of the most venerable academic, political and literary figures of the nineteenth and twentieth century have taken the podium at Sanders Theatre including Winston Churchill, Theodore Roosevelt, and Martin Luther King, Jr. Sanders is presently home to several undergraduate choir and orchestral groups and also serves as a venue for many professional performance ensembles including Boston Philharmonic Orchestra, Boston Chamber Music Society, Christmas Revels, Masterworks Chorale and Boston Baroque. The statue on the left side of the stage by Thomas Crawford is of James Otis. Sanders Theater is only available for public viewing for certain performances."),

It is one of the seven original houses at the College. Opened in 1931, the house was named after Charles William Eliot, who served as president of the university for forty years (1869–1909). Before Harvard opted to use a lottery system to assign residences to upperclassmen (beginning with the class of 1999), Eliot was known as a 'prep' house, providing accommodation to the university's social elite, and being known as 'more Harvard than Harvard'. Describing Eliot House in the late 1950s and early 1960s, author Alston Chase wrote, ‘[A]lthough most Harvard houses in those days reflected the values of Boston Brahmin society ...

Kirkland is one of the smallest Houses at Harvard, but has nevertheless managed to win many intramural and house-spirit contests, most recently the 2012 Straus Cup. Before Harvard opted to use a lottery system to assign housing to upperclassmen, Kirkland was considered the 'jock house' because its location near Anderson Bridge and the Soldiers Field made it a desirable home and convenient place to dine for Harvard athletes. Kirkland House boasts many traditions, such as its opening ceremony (complete with Minutemen reenactors playing the drums and fife as they process around the House, followed by the house masters, tutors, and students), Secret Santa week (an in-house-only series of gifts, jokes, and events) -- accompanied by bawdy skits in the dining hall, and a winter dance nicknamed ‘IncestFest’ (a debaucherous dance open only to members of the house)."),

Surprisingly, given the House’s current appeal, Adams was not popular initially; the Victorian era rooms of the Gold Coast buildings seemed dark and 'Germanic' to 1930's taste, and many students preferred the entirely up-to-date neo-Colonial structures of Eliot, Winthrop and Dunster Houses.[2] Adams' location, however, (it is the closest of all the Houses to Harvard Yard) and its reputation for good food (it is one of the few Harvard Houses that doesn't share a kitchen) soon overcame any perceived architectural deficiencies. In fact, some of these same “deficiencies” turned out to be quite handy: students in the 1940s and 1950s wishing to avoid the College's strict nightly curfews and parietal rules came to greatly value Adams' multiple and unguarded entries, unlike the central, monitored portals of the newer undergraduate residences.

Dunster is unique among Harvard dormitories for its sixth-story walk-up (it has no elevators); these rooms were originally rented by poorer students, such as Norman Mailer. The House was named in honor of Henry Dunster, a ‘learned, conscionable and industrious man,’ who became the first President of Harvard University. He was appointed to the Harvard presidency at the age of thirty-one, immediately after his arrival in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1640. He held the office during the early ‘troublous’ years of the Colony and left the College in 1654 after it had become a well-established institution.

The area was formerly used as housing for Radcliffe College, and as such the four towers of Currier House are named for distinguished alumnae of Radcliffe, including the author Barbara Tuchman and composer Mabel Daniels. Along with Cabot House and Pforzheimer House, Currier is part of the former Radcliffe Quadrangle, known colloquially within the college as simply, ‘The Quad’. Because of its distance from most of the other residential houses, its physical layout (which places most of the house's social space near the entrance), and its small size (it has the smallest population of any house), many Currier residents consider the house to have one of the strongest and most cohesive house communities of Harvard's residential houses. Students routinely rank Currier's dining hall highest among Harvard dining halls in food quality. In 2005, Currier renovated a common space known as the ‘Fishbowl’ to create an entertainment center complete with a big screen projector and surround sound system. In early 2006, Currier painted many of its interior walls to produce a more colorful atmosphere.

The membership voted to become a Final Club in 1900 and in 1902 severed ties with the national fraternity to which it had maintained only loose ties.
